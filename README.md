You can test this by two ways:

1. You can go into a browser and open up the developer console (usually F12 on your keyboard). Copy the class into the console and press enter. Then after copy the rest of the file into the console and press enter. This should print the results into the console.

2. You can use a repl to test it. Create a node.js enviromnent and copy the contents of the file into it and click run and it should print out some test cases I made.

I wasn't really sure what a Promise was, so I spent some time in the hour, trying to understand what it was.
